## 1. Screenshots of Application Pages
- Home
- Events page
- Events Detail
- New Event
- Login
- Sign up
- About
- Contact

(Note: Screenshots to be added here)

## 2. Explanation of Additional Features
- JavaScript for inserting headers and footers, allowing for easy across-the-board changes in one location (js/script.js)
- Preliminary code for dynamic event data storage (currently non-functional)
- Contact page for future implementation of direct user communication

## 3. Status, Stopping Point, and Issues
- Frontend is mostly complete
- Areas for improvement:
  - More information about the organization and website purpose
  - Styling for login/signup pages (intentionally left unstyled as a reminder of incompleteness)
- Incomplete and unused code files await backend establishment
- Events currently hard-coded in HTML
  - Considered JSON file approach, but decided against due to CORS issues and anticipated database implementation

## 4. Easy and Challenging Parts
Easy:
- Initial source code setup (similar to previous lab requirements)
- Consistent header and footer implementation using js/script.js

Challenging:
- Proper alignment and grouping of header and footer elements
- Conceptualizing dynamic event population without a backend
- Navigating multiple HTML files in a static website environment
